Welcome! 

I am currently a PhD candidate under the supervision of Fabienne Lesueur in the Genetic Epidemiology of Cancer team (U900) at Institut Curie (Paris). My work focuses on the characterization of breast tumours developed by ATM germline variant carriers using bioinformatic analyses of multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic and methylome) and histological whole slides images with deep learning methods.

Please feel free to explore my website to learn more about me and my research (this website is currently being updated, so not every information may be up to date).

#Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
